# Overview

This folder contains the `jupyter notebooks` for reproducing the figures presented in the main paper on the top level, and the corresponding figures in the `figures/` subfolder. 

A tutorial showing how to run `MNLE` on the DDM can be found in `MNLE-Tutorial.ipynb`. 

In addition, the folder `revision-experiments` contains results from the revision phase of the paper submission. 
During revision we conducted additional experiments. We ran LAN on smaller simulation budgets in order to enable a direct comparison to MNLE. The folder holds scripts, pre-trained NN models and data.
